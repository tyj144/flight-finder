## Info
**Flight Finder** is a web app that helps users discover new places by generating a new vacation destination for them. The app will then find flight tickets and provide location information for them using the Wikipedia API.

The flight finding algorithm uses a JetBlue dataset of over 100,000 flights to build the user's trip and was designed for the "JetBlue: Best Use of JetBlue Low Fares and Deals Data" prize at [YHack](https://www.yhack.org/) 2017.

The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend was made using Django, the Python web framework.

The project code is available on GitHub as a Django app. All settings, URL management, and deployment files are not available here.
